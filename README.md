# Banking System in C++

## Project Overview
This is a simple **Banking System** implemented in C++ as a console application. The system allows users to create accounts, view account details, deposit and withdraw money, and check balances. It is designed as a basic project to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like file handling and control structures in C++.

## Features
- Create a new account.
- View account details.
- Deposit money.
- Withdraw money.
- Check account balance.
- Exit the system.
